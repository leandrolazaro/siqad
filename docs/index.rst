SiQAD Documentation
===================

SiQAD (**Si**\ licon **Q**\ uantum **A**\ tomic **D**\ esigner) is a next-generation CAD tool that enables the design and simulation of silicon dangling bond (DB) circuits through an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) and a modular simulation back-end. The tool currently offers simulators that predict ground-state and dynamic electron configuration of given DB configurations, and electrostatics simulation given electrode layouts. There are a few key resources available:

* Feel free to join our `official Slack team <https://join.slack.com/t/siqad/shared_invite/zt-enavwvlg-anRYYpslNbpxXI96zx4Wxg>`_ for SiQAD-related discussion and support!
* Please read the `SiQAD publication on IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology <https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8963859>`_ (open access) for a detailed introduction to the tool and simulators.
* Please read the :ref:`basic_tutorial_doc` to familiarize with basic SiQAD features through a step-by-step tutorial.
* The `Walus Lab website <https://waluslab.ece.ubc.ca/siqad/>`_ contains information about us and other projects that we work on.
